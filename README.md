My game uses continuous inputs from the player in destroying the pegs during gameplay.\
It uses discrete inputs by having the player destroy the 'rectangle' at a specific time.\
The player's goal can only be achieved by timing the destruction correctly in order to get the ball into the bucket\
I have 3 physics-based gameplay scenes in 'level1', 'level2', and 'level3'\
I have Summary scenes for each level, as well as intro, outro, and title screen\
All of my data assets were created by me using pixelartmaker.com\



Commit 1: Created all of the files and set up index.html\
Commit 2: Finished intro, title screen, and level 1.\
Commit 3: Finished the vast majority of what was left.\
Commit 4: Finished the outro and cleaned up the game.
